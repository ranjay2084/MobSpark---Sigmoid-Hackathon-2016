# MobSpark - Sigmoid-Hackathon-2016
MobSpark is a project where we try to create clusters of mobile phones to execute tasks.


In the first phase of the project we are working on triggering Spark jobs from an android phone which would run on a cluster and repond with results.

We use REST APIs to send requests and recieve Spark job sttus and results.

In the next phase we intend to use mobile phones as executors in the cluster where small computations could be easily executed.
